This is a Simple Twitter project from Alpha Camp in semester 3 (frontend), and could be regarded as a capstone of our learning journey.  
There will be a series of updates from this topic, so we'll keep updating through time while upscaling our skills in JSX, components, Sass, etc.

The image below shows what it will look like.
